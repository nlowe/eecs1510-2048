## eecs1510-2048
A text-based clone of 2048 (which is itself a clone of "3's"). Developed for EECS 1510 (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming)

### Dependencies
You need Java 8. I intend at writing a gradle build script at some point, so you'll eventually need that too.

### Building
Eventually I'll get around to writing a gradle script. For now, I'd just recommend just putting the project in an IDE.
