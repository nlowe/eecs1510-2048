## eecs1510-2048
A text-based clone of 2048 (which is itself a clone of "3's"). Developed for EECS 1510 (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming)

### Dependencies
You need Java 8. If you want to build outside of an IDE, you'll need Gradle. I'm using 2.3.

### Building
Run `gradle -jar` from the project root. This will generate `eecs1510-2048.jar`. Launch it with

```text
java -jar eecs1510-2048.jar [options]
```

If you are just testing the application, you can run it directly with `gradle run -q`
